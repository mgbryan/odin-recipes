    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A taquito, taco dorado, rolled taco, or flauta is a Mexican dish that 
        typically consists of a small rolled-up tortilla that contains filling, 
        including beef, cheese or chicken. The filled tortilla is then shallow-fried 
        or deep-fried. The dish is often topped with condiments 
        such as sour cream and guacamole.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Once your meat of choice is fully cooked, add it to a flat tortilla and tightly roll it
            ensuring to place them seam down.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1 cup oil in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat until 325 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Once hot, add 2-4 flautas seam side down in oil.</li>
        <li>Fry, turning as needed until golden brown on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes, adjusting burner 
            as necessary to maintain oil temperature so they donâ€™t fry too quickly.

        <li>Remove flautas from hot oil, allow them to cool down for 30 seconds, then top with your choice of
            salsa, cheeses, and lettuce.
